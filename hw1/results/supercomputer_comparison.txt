Estimating Time to Crack 256-bit RSA
===================================

Supercomputer Specifications:
  Name: Frontier (ORNL)
  Peak Performance: 1.10e+18 FLOPS
  CPU Cores: 8,699,904
  Memory: 700 TB
  Year: 2022
  Location: Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA

Cracking Time Estimates:
  Your Machine: 0.00 seconds
  Frontier (ORNL): 0.00 seconds

Speed-up Factor:
  Frontier (ORNL) is approximately 2.20e+08 times faster than your machine

Security Context:
  WARNING: This key size might be vulnerable to a determined attacker with access
  to supercomputing resources. Modern RSA implementations typically use 2048-bit
  or 4096-bit keys to ensure long-term security.

Note on Quantum Computing:
  Quantum computers using Shor's algorithm could theoretically break RSA encryption
  much faster. A sufficiently powerful quantum computer could factor an RSA-256 key
  in seconds to minutes. However, current quantum computers are not yet capable of
  breaking RSA keys of any practical size.
